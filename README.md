# post-install
This a simple script to run after a Debian based install. I use this after installing Ubuntu, Kali, Raspberry Pi, Xubuntu, and various others DEB based installs.

This uses a command line menu system (whiptail) for selecting the various componenets.  Nothing will execute when first running.  Have no fear!

    $ git clone https://github.com/cdjackson14/post-install
    $ cd post-install
    $ ./post-install
